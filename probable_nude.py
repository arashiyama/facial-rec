'''
This script uses a Haar cascade classifier trained for skin detection to detect skin in the image. 
If any skin is detected, it prints a message indicating the presence of probable nudity. 
Note that this script is not guaranteed to accurately detect all instances of nudity, and may produce false positives or false negatives. 
It is intended for research and testing purposes only, and should not be used to make decisions about the appropriateness of content.
