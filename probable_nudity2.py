'''
This script uses a pre-trained classifier to predict the probability that an image contains probable nudity. 
The classifier was trained using the histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) feature extraction method and a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. 
The script converts the image to grayscale and extracts HOG features from the image, 
and then uses the classifier to predict the probability that the image contains probable nudity. 
If the probability is greater than 0.5, the script outputs "Probable nudity detected". Otherwise, it outputs "No probable nudity detected".

It is also important to keep in mind that the performance of this script will depend on the quality and characteristics of the training data used to build the classifier, and it may not be accurate in all cases.
