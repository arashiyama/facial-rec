'''
This script loads a dataset of images and uses the histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) feature extraction method to extract features from each image. 
It then trains a support vector machine (SVM) classifier on the extracted features and labels, and tests the classifier using a holdout dataset. 
Finally, it saves the trained classifier to a file using the joblib library.

Note that this script is intended for illustration purposes only, and you will need to modify it to suit your specific needs. 
In particular, you will need to provide your own dataset of images, with the labels indicating whether each image contains probable nudity or not. 
You may also want to consider using additional feature extraction methods or different machine learning algorithms to improve the performance of the classifier.
